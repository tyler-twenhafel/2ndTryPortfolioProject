        <p id="about_me">Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Tyler, I'm from Frederick, MD, and here are some of my favorite projects.</p>

        <p id="form_a_story_about">The Form-A-Story website is a fun site that helps you form a story! This site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are multiple input spots that suggest what to put in the boxes, then the user presses the "Form My Story!" button and a new page is brought up that shows the user's chosen entries in story form!</p>
        <p id="piano_keys_about">This Piano Player site gives instructions on how to play the working piano. When the user clicks the "Line 2" button, line 2 is brought up and a "Line 3" button appears. It goes through the whole Happy Birthday song and then the user is given an option to repeat. I used HTML, CSS, and also JavaScript.</p>
        <p id="club_website_about">The Rick and Morty Fanclub website is a simple site that uses basic HTML and CSS. There is not much interactivity but it was a great opportunity to practice design and styling. It was one of the first projects I did with ease, it represents confidence to me. Even if you are just starting out, celebrate the small victories!</p>
