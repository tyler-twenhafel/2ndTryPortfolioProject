        <p id="about_me">My name is Tyler Twenhafel, I am 23 years old, and I am a student in the Web Development field. This page is a portfolio of a few of my projects, basically bragging grounds. I started learning code in the summer of 2019. I started with an online bootcamp (that shall remain nameless because this is not a review). Unfortunately, I didn't click with said bootcamp. My next step was taking classes at a local community college. The classes were fast-paced and low-instruction, safe to say it just wasn't my learning style. After completing the classes, I moved on to the process of finding the right bootcamp. It took weeks of searching and researching and comparing until I found Codecademy. The style of the program was instantly helpful and I found myself actually having fun! After cruising through HTML and CSS, which as a designer I loved, I started JavaScript. It opened a whole new realm of possibility that got me excited to learn! My goal is to be a full stack web developer. My ideal job would be helping small business get a good website up and running. Growing up in a small town made me appreciate small businesses, and after years of enjoying the mom and pop shops littering Downtown Frederick, I want to give back to the small business community. A business having a website can make or break it for them! The first three seconds make the most impact and having a cramped and hard to navigate website is sure to deter potential customers. That's where I can step in and make a beautiful and easy to navigate website to draw in more customers!</p>
